My name is Natalie, but most people call me by my middle name, Grace :) I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Washington (go dawgs!), where I am advised by [Yoshi Kohno](https://sites.google.com/view/yoshi-kohno/). I'm interested in understanding and mitigating sociotechnical harms of emerging technologies, particularly AI.

You can learn more about me in my <a href="/assets/pdf/BrighamCV.pdf" target="blank">CV</a>.

      alt="A window of three images. On the right is a photo of a big tree in a green field in a field of grass and a bright blue sky. The two on the left are simplifications created based on a decision tree algorithm. The work illustrates a popular type of machine learning model: the decision tree. Decision trees work by splitting the population into ever smaller segments. I try to give people an intuitive understanding of the algorithm. I also want to show that models are simplifications of reality, but can still be useful, or in this case visually pleasing. To create this I trained a model to predict pixel colour values, based on an original photograph of a tree."
